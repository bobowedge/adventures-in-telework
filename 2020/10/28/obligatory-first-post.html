<p>There have been a couple of times in my life where I felt at least somewhat drawn to write about various aspects of my life or what was doing. Usually, the feeling dies quickly as I have some combination of the following 3 thoughts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>No one will read what you wrote, probably including yourself</li>
  <li>It’s too much work to stay active blogging and you know you’re not gonna do it</li>
  <li>If you’re writing, then you’re not working or coding or doing something productive
These thoughts inevitably kill any desire I have to keep writing. I think the last time I wrote anything on regular basis was on Xanga, probably more than 10 years ago.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="so-why-now">So, why now?</h2>

<p>About halfway into the third lesson of <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a>, the instructors implore their students to start writing about their data science journeys. In particular, they suggest to start by documenting and writing about their work in the course itself, as a way of cementing the information that’s learned. On top of that, they introduced <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a> as way to create a blog using a combination of Jupyter notebooks or markdown pages (or even Word docs) that’s as simple as updating a git repo (after some minor initial setup). And, thus, this blog was born.</p>

<p>Admittedly, it also helps that I have been given the opportunity to telework about one day a week to do professional development. So, writing this blog counts as work, which mitigates #3 pretty well.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>For me, the first couple of lessons prior to that in the course produced a couple of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that I think are interesting and worth documenting, if only for myself.  I suspect that will continue to be the case as I progress through the next lessons.  Since I’m hopeful that I’ll continue to be able to have time for professional development, I’m hopeful I can and will continue to write about whatever telework brings next.</p>
